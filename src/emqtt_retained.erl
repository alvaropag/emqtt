%% RETAIN
%% Position: byte 1, bit 0.

%% This flag is only used on PUBLISH messages. When a client sends a PUBLISH to a server, if the Retain flag is set (1), the server should hold on to the message after it has been delivered to the current subscribers.

%% When a new subscription is established on a topic, the last retained message on that topic should be sent to the subscriber with the Retain flag set. If there is no retained message, nothing is sent

%% This is useful where publishers send messages on a "report by exception" basis, where it might be some time between messages. This allows new subscribers to instantly receive data with the retained, or Last Known Good, value.

%% When a server sends a PUBLISH to a client as a result of a subscription that already existed when the original PUBLISH arrived, the Retain flag should not be set, regardless of the Retain flag of the original PUBLISH. This allows a client to distinguish messages that are being received because they were retained and those that are being received "live".

%% Retained messages should be kept over restarts of the server.

%% A server may delete a retained message if it receives a message with a zero-length payload and the Retain flag set on the same topic.
